Welcome to the University of Washington USLI code repository!

What is included:
    README          - This file
    USLIPayload.ino - Main driver program
    libraries/      - Functions to interface with payload's sensors.
    prototypes/     - Experimental code that isn't working properly yet.

Downloading a copy:
    1: Check out a copy of the source.
    2: Copy the contents of the <libraries> directory into <Arduino\libraries>
       (The "Arduino" folder is the one that contains all your sketches.
       If you are using Windows, it's normally found in My Documents.)
    3: Open the Arduino SDK and load "USLIPayload.ino".

Editing the source:
    1: USLIPayload.ino and README may be modified directly.
    2: Libraries must be edited in place, in the <Arduino\libraries> directory.

Uploading revisions:
    1: Copy the contents of <Arduino\libraries> back into <libraries>
    2: Commit changes, then push to the main repository.
